# Pokedex

This is simply constructed webpage, that shows all species of Pokemons, build with JavaScript/JQuery for my self educational purposes only.

## How does it work:
get JSON with API and parse them to useful page that shows some information about Pokemons like picture with name, id number, types and other.
response at all popular screens
## Launch:
For launch you need [download ZIP] (https://github.com/VsevolodMart/pokemon__/archive/master.zip) and open index.html file in browser https://github.com/VsevolodMart/pokemon__/archive/master.zip
